I made a simple redis client based on the hiredis example ( redis-2.6.14/deps/hiredis/example.c ) to demonstrate the use from C.
You can compile it with cc -o redisclient redisclient.c libhiredis.a command.
If you want to specify the host from terminal, run ./redisclient 127.0.0.1:6379.
If you don't define, it will use the adress and port in this example.
Supported commands: get, set, incr, decr.
