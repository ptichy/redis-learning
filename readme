I made a simple redis client in C based on the hiredis example ( redis-2.6.14/deps/hiredis/example.c ) to demonstrate how to use hiredis.
You can compile it with cc -o redisclient redisclient.c libhiredis.a command or run makefile.
If you want to specify the host from terminal, run ./redisclient 127.0.0.1:6379.
If you don't define, it will use the adress and port in this example.
Type exit to quit.
Supported commands: get, set, del, incr, decr.
  get key
  set key value
  set age 21
  incr age
  decr age
  del age
